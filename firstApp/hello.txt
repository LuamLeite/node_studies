Hello from Node.js
//In node you don't only write code that your server will run it.
You also write the code that take all the requests and redirects it to other code.

Two ways of executing your code.

1.REPL -> Read, evaluate, print, loop.
You can use the REPL by using node in the terminal.
It works, but it won't store your code.

2.Execute files -> Execute code as you write-it, used for reall apps.

rest 
newArray = [...arrayAntigo];
spread 
function = (...args); //acept unlimited number of args

Destructuring
const printName ({ name }) //it will get just the property name of the object
{
    console.log(name);
}
//You can also desestructure arrays
const hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking'];
const [hobby1, hobby2] = hobbies;
console.log(hobby1, hobby2);
//it will print by position
